## **üîß Components**

- **Arduino UNO** ‚Äì The central microcontroller for controlling sensors and processing data.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** ‚Äì Detects obstacles in front of the user by emitting and receiving ultrasonic waves.
- **Gyroscope (MPU6050)** ‚Äì Monitors the orientation and movement of the cane to enhance stability and motion detection.
- **Buzzer** ‚Äì Provides auditory alerts when an obstacle is detected or during emergency situations.
- **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)** ‚Äì Automatically turns on an LED in low-light environments to improve visibility and notify others of the user‚Äôs presence.
- **Vibrational Sensor** ‚Äì Detects collisions or impacts and provides immediate feedback.
- **Bluetooth Module** ‚Äì Enables wireless communication with the smartphone app for monitoring and configuration.
- **SOS Button** ‚Äì Allows the user to send an emergency alert easily.
- **Collapsible Walking Stick** ‚Äì Durable and portable design suitable for daily use.
- **Battery** ‚Äì Powers the entire system.
- **Breadboard & Jumper Wires** ‚Äì For prototyping and connecting components.

## **üìñ Methodology**

1. **Obstacle Detection**
   - The Ultrasonic Sensor continuously scans the front area for objects within a predefined range (2 cm to 5 m).
   - Upon detection, information is transmitted to the Arduino UNO.

2. **Alert System**
   - The buzzer sounds progressively faster as the obstacle gets closer.
   - The LDR controls an LED, which activates automatically in low-light conditions.
   - The Vibrational Sensor triggers additional alerts when collisions occur.

3. **User Emergency**
   - The SOS button allows the user to trigger an emergency alert via Bluetooth to the connected app.

4. **Sturdiness & Portability**
   - The collapsible design ensures easy transport and a sturdy structure resistant to accidental drops.
